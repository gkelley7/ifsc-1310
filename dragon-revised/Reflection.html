<p>In this class, I learned what is possible with HTML. The language had been a mystery to me at the beginning of the semester, as I never really thought about what makes websites run and look good. 
I did not think that I would enjoy writing code so much. I realize now that seeing something visually appear in response to my input is something I like a lot, which may prompt me to consider Web Design
as a field to look into later on. After taking this course, I now have a far better understanding of the intricacies behind the scenes of the websites I frequent every day.</p>

<p> With the Dragon project specifically, I actually got to play around with building a webpage from the ground up. I learned what CSS design elements are possible and how to implement them. I also learned 
what works best when trying to format text on a webpage and effective ways to make things flow organically on a site. Additionally, I slowly became less sloppy and more efficient with my code as I tried 
to find better ways of going about different things on the site.</p> 

<p>In all, I have had a good time in this course and it has really opened my eyes to the opportunities having proficient HTML and CSS abilities have to offer. I really like how I can just play around with 
it and discover new design elements. There is so much more for me to learn, and I appreciate you for helping me get my foot in the door on this stuff. </p>
